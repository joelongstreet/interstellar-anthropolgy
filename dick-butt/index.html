        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The artifact informally designated “Dickbutt” represents one of the
          most widely reproduced visual motifs recovered from Earth’s Late
          Digital Period. Surviving instances appear across personal
          communications, institutional systems, and machine-level storage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite its minimal construction and lack of apparent informational
          content, the image persisted across decades and platforms, suggesting
          a role beyond novelty or authorship.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section" id="description">
        <h2>Physical Description</h2>
        <p>
          The figure consists of a simplified bipedal form rendered with minimal
          anatomical fidelity. Primary anatomical features associated with
          reproduction and waste elimination are repositioned into a single
          composite structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Line work is crude and inconsistent. Proportions vary widely between
          instances. No canonical version has been identified, though
          recognition remains immediate even in degraded or partial
          reproductions.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section" id="assessment">
        <h2>Computational Assessment</h2>
        <p>
          Data processing conducted by autonomous Earth-based systems after
          planetary collapse ranked the motif among the most frequently
          encountered cultural icons in surviving datasets. In multiple
          archives, its prevalence exceeded that of political identifiers,
          institutional insignia, and documented historical events.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reasons for this ranking remain unresolved. Current evidence
          supports the view that persistence depended on recognizability rather
          than meaning.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section" id="domestic">
        <h2>Domestic Environment</h2>
        <p>
          Instances of the motif have been identified within residential
          settings, often in proximity to leisure devices, combustion-based
          waste systems, and personal transportation artifacts. These
          environments show no evidence of formal curation or preservation.

      <section class="section" id="behavior">
        <h2>Behavioral Evidence</h2>
        <p>
          Anthropological reconstructions depict Earthlings exhibiting relaxed
          posture, reduced attentional engagement, and passive consumption
          behaviors when interacting with memetic artifacts such as “Dickbutt.”
          Laughter responses are frequently documented, though explanations are
          seldom provided.

      <section class="section" id="education">
        <h2>Educational Transmission</h2>
        <p>
          The motif appears within reconstructed instructional environments,
          where it is presented without formal explanation. Its inclusion
          alongside unrelated material suggests that humor functioned
          independently of curriculum and was sustained through recognition
          alone.

      <section class="section" id="ritual">
        <h2>Ritualized Interpretation</h2>
        <p>
          In several reconstructions, the artifact is positioned as a focal
          object within communal spaces. Synchronized postures and repeated
          orientation toward the figure suggest ritualized behavior, though no
          standardized doctrine has been identified.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether these practices were symbolic, ironic, or incidental remains
          undocumented.

      <section class="section" id="environment">
        <h2>Environmental Correlation</h2>
        <p>
          High concentrations of memetic artifacts are frequently associated
          with dense urban environments, infrastructural strain, and large-scale
          combustion events. Causality has not been established.
        </p>

      <section class="section" id="notes">
        <h2>Notes from the Archive</h2>
        <p>
          Attempts to refine or modernize the image consistently failed.
          Long-term exposure did not diminish recognition. The artifact was
          almost never explained.
        </p>
        <p>
          No evidence suggests the motif conveyed instructional, ethical, or
          survival-related information. Its persistence alone appears to have
          been sufficient.
