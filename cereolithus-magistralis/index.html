        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          <em>Cereolithus magistralis</em> is a slow-growing, columnar cactus
          native to the basalt plains and fractured stone fields of Kaelune-7.
          It is distinguished by a paired biological structure composed of two
          autonomous organisms that grow in close physical association along a
          shared vertical axis.
        </p>
        <p>
          At a distance, the plant appears singular. Closer observation reveals
          an external structural form enclosing a second, internally situated
          organism. Though spatially interdependent, the two remain biologically
          distinct.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section" id="description">
        <h2>Physical Description</h2>
        <p>
          The outer organism of <em>C. magistralis</em> develops a ribbed,
          lattice-like structure with high mineral density and limited chromatic
          variation. Its growth favors structural continuity, with evenly
          distributed vertical ribs that channel heat inward and release it
          gradually during periods of cooling. This form provides environmental
          buffering in regions marked by extreme thermal fluctuation and limited
          surface water.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within this framework, a second organism grows independently. The
          inner cactus occupies the negative space defined by the outer shell,
          exhibiting greater chromatic diversity and surface variation. Its form
          follows the same axial logic as the outer structure while diverging in
          texture, rhythm, and coloration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both organisms store water and trace silicates within porous internal
          matrices, contributing to their shared resilience.
        </p>

      <section class="section" id="symbiotic">
        <h2>Symbiotic Structure</h2>
        <p>
          <em>Cereolithus magistralis</em> does not represent a single organism
          with differentiated tissues, but a paired system of two fully
          independent plants occupying a shared form.
        </p>
        <p>
          The outer organism establishes first, defining the overall silhouette
          and spatial constraints. Once present, the inner organism develops
          within these constraints, expanding upward and outward while remaining
          physically separate. No direct vascular, root, or structural
          connections between the two have been identified.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite their proximity, neither organism appears to dominate or
          subsume the other.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section" id="mimetic">
        <h2>Mimetic Growth</h2>
        <p>
          Field observations indicate that the inner cactus mirrors the growth
          patterns of the outer organism. Subtle irregularities in rib spacing,
          curvature, compression, and vertical rhythm are echoed internally,
          though never duplicated exactly.
        </p>
        <p>
          This correspondence appears interpretive rather than mechanical. Each
          imperfection in the outer structure is re-expressed by the inner
          organism in its own material language. The mechanism by which this
          alignment occurs remains undocumented.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kaeluni botanists caution against assuming a directional flow of
          influence. While the outer organism provides structure, the inner
          exhibits greater adaptive variation over time.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section" id="ecology">
        <h2>Ecology and Growth Patterns</h2>
        <p>
          <em>Cereolithus magistralis</em> is rarely found growing untended.
          Most documented specimens occur near long-established dwellings or
          sites of sustained habitation. Paired systems developing in isolation
          tend to show reduced internal complexity and weaker mimetic
          correspondence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Growth is incremental and uneven. Variations in symmetry are not
          considered defects, but environmental records comparable to growth
          rings or sediment layers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Excessive intervention is discouraged. Both organisms respond best to
          stable conditions and long periods without disturbance.

      <section class="section" id="culture">
        <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
        <p>
          Among Kaeluni families, <em>Cereolithus magistralis</em> is exchanged
          as a gesture of recognition between parents and other tusted
          caregivers. It is given in acknowledgment of steady guidance, patience
          under pressure, and the quiet labor of raising others well.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cactus is not presented to mark a beginning or an achievement, but
          to honor an ongoing role. In Kaeluni tradition, such gifts are
          exchanged between those who share responsibility, as a way of
          affirming trust in one another's judgment and care.
        </p>
        <p>
          The paired nature of the plant is widely understood but rarely
          discussed directly.

      <section class="section" id="continuity">
        <h2>Material Continuity</h2>
        <p>
          After the death of a specimen, <em>Cereolithus magistralis</em> is not
          discarded. Among the Kaeluni, the plant's mineral-rich structure is
          ground and incorporated into the fabrication of household objects,
          including containers used for cultivating new specimens.
        </p>
        <p>
          Early interpretations of this practice framed it as symbolic or
          superstitious. It was believed that the material composition of the
          container could influence the growth behavior of the cactus it held.
          Subsequent studies have demonstrated that this influence is
          measurable. Trace silicates and organic residues present in the
          processed material appear to affect growth rhythm, internal alignment,
          and mimetic correspondence between paired organisms.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this reason, Kaeluni containers are rarely composed of a single
          source specimen. Material from multiple generations and unrelated
          organisms is often combined, producing vessels with complex
          compositional histories. Such containers are favored for cultivation,
          as they are understood to provide a broader range of influence on
          developing plants.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this way, continuity is maintained not through preservation of
          form, but through redistribution of material.

      <section class="section" id="stewardship">
        <h2>Use and Stewardship</h2>
        <p>
          No formal rituals govern the placement or care of
          <em>C. magistralis</em>. Specimens are often kept where light shifts
          gradually across the day, though no orientation is prescribed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The plant is valued less for display than for its continued presence.
          It is not uncommon for individuals to forget precisely when a
          particular specimen was placed.

      <section class="section" id="inheritance">
        <h2>Somatic Inheritance</h2>
        <p>
          In certain Kaeluni regions, mature specimens of
          <em>Cereolithus magistralis</em> are consumed during rare ceremonial
          gatherings. The practice is neither commemorative nor instructional.
          Participants do not report recalling events, narratives, or
          identifiable individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, consumption is associated with transient affective states:
          sensations of steadiness, restraint, fatigue without distress, and
          attentiveness without urgency. These effects are consistently
          described as non-specific and resistant to interpretation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Biochemical analysis indicates that mineralized compounds retained
          within the plant’s structure persist across generations of growth.
          When metabolized, these compounds appear to influence autonomic
          regulation rather than cognition, producing physiological responses
          associated with emotional tone rather than memory.
        </p>
        <p>
          The experience is understood among the Kaeluni not as communion with
          ancestors, but as exposure to accumulated disposition.

      <section class="section" id="practice">
        <h2>Cultural Practice</h2>
        <p>
          Participation in these ceremonies is limited and infrequent. The
          practice is not associated with mourning, celebration, or transition.
          It is most often undertaken during periods of uncertainty, when
          continuity rather than change is desired.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Kaeluni distinguish this practice from oral history or
          instruction. No attempt is made to interpret the experience.
          Participants are advised not to discuss specific sensations beyond
          acknowledging their presence.
        </p>
        <p>The value of the ritual lies in restraint.</p>

          Older specimens frequently show increased divergence between inner and
          outer forms, particularly in coloration and surface rhythm. This
          divergence is not considered degradation, but maturation.
